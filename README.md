CORS_PORT= // Port on which the frontend will run

# Defining the port 
PORT= // port on which mysql server is running

# Server port
SPORT= // Port on which the backend server will run (should be 8808)

# Password for the database

# Host 
HOST= // Host for the database (usually localhost)

# Database name
DB_NAME=

# Secret for the session
